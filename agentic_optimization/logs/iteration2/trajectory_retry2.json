NAVIGATE TO THE CODE:\n   cd /Users/jackluo/Documents/workspace/agent_performance_optimization/agentic_optimization/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas\n   Explore the directory structure to understand the codebase\n\n2. START WITH PROFILING DATA (if available):\n   - The profiling data shows which functions consume the most time\n   - These are your PRIMARY targets, but not your ONLY targets\n   - Hot functions often call other functions - trace the call chain\n   - Sometimes the bottleneck is in data structures used across many functions\n\n3. UNDERSTAND THE WORKLOAD:\n   - Analyze what operations the workload is testing\n   - Identify the code paths being exercised\n   - Look for algorithmic improvements (O(n\u00b2) \u2192 O(n log n))\n\n4. CONSIDER BROADER OPTIMIZATIONS:\n   - Data structure changes (lists \u2192 sets, dicts \u2192 arrays)\n   - Reducing memory allocations (avoid unnecessary copies)\n   - Caching computed values\n   - Batch processing instead of individual operations\n   - Lazy evaluation where appropriate\n\n5. DON'T BE AFRAID TO REFACTOR:\n   - If profiling shows a hot function, look at:\n     * What calls it (can we reduce calls?)\n     * What it calls (are those functions efficient?)\n     * The data structures it uses (can we improve them?)\n   - Sometimes the best optimization is NOT in the hot function itself,\n     but in changing how it's used or what data it receives\n\n\ud83d\udccb OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:\n\u2713 Navigate to /Users/jackluo/Documents/workspace/agent_performance_optimization/agentic_optimization/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas\n\u2713 Review profiling data (if available) as a starting point\n\u2713 Analyze the workload to understand what's being tested\n\u2713 Find the relevant source files (use find, ls, or search)\n\u2713 Look for algorithmic improvements first (biggest impact)\n\u2713 Consider data structure optimizations\n\u2713 Reduce unnecessary memory allocations\n\u2713 Test your changes don't break correctness\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f REQUIREMENTS:\n- Maintain all public APIs and interfaces\n- Preserve correctness (must pass all tests)\n- Edit files in /Users/jackluo/Documents/workspace/agent_performance_optimization/agentic_optimization/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas\n- Add comments explaining optimizations\n\n\ud83d\udca1 PROFILING PHILOSOPHY:\nThe profiling data is a GUIDE, not a CONSTRAINT. It shows you where to START looking,\nbut the best optimization might involve:\n- Changing data structures used by hot functions\n- Reducing calls to hot functions\n- Optimizing functions that hot functions call\n- Improving algorithms that span multiple functions\n\nEXAMPLES OF THINKING BEYOND HOT FUNCTIONS:\n- Hot function does list.append() in a loop \u2192 Use list comprehension or preallocate\n- Hot function is called 1000 times \u2192 Can we batch the calls?\n- Hot function uses dict lookups \u2192 Would a set or different data structure be faster?\n- Hot function has O(n\u00b2) algorithm \u2192 Can we reduce to O(n log n)?\n\nWhen you're done optimizing, run:\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT\nEOF\n)\n\nYou can execute bash commands and edit files to implement the necessary changes.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\nThis workflows should be done step-by-step so that you can iterate on your changes and any possible problems.\n\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n6.
